-   **Authenticity**: Zero tolerance for unverified information.
-   **Transparency**: Every answer is backed by clear references to primary sources.
-   **Inclusivity**: Respectful handling of differing valid scholarly opinions (Madhhabs).
-   **Adab (Etiquette)**: A user experience designed with the dignity of the content in mind.
